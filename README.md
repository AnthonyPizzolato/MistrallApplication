 MISTRAL Chatbot Application

> A chatbot application that takes a PDF or DOCX file from the local directory, generates a study guide, and optionally creates practice questions based on the content. This is done by chunking the documents for efficient tokenization and processing by the language model.

## Overview
The MISTRAL Chatbot Application allows users to upload educational documents (PDF/DOCX) and receive tailored study guides or study guides with practice questions generated by a large language model (LLM). This project leverages libraries such as `vllm`, `PyTorch`, `transformers`, `pypdf2`, and `python-docx`.

## Features
- **Document Upload**: Accepts PDF and DOCX formats for easy file handling.
- **Study Guide Generation**: Extracts key concepts and summaries.
- **Practice Questions Creation**: Optionally generates questions to reinforce learning.
- **Efficient Tokenization**: Uses document chunking for optimized LLM performance.

## Testing
Testing ensures the application's functionality and compatibility with different document types.

1. **End-to-End Testing**  
   - Prepare sample text documents and run the application end-to-end to confirm the functionality.
   - Verify the output for study guide content and, if applicable, practice questions.

2. **Unit Tests**  
   - Run unit tests for each function using `pytest`:
     ```bash
     pytest tests/
     ```
   - Unit tests cover document parsing, chunking, and output generation.
